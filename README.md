# Group Project
In this project, created by Jack Russell and Andrew McMeans, we created a reccomendation app that suggests what clothes you wear depending on the current weather!

## Technical Requirements

1. Flask Server
2. Postgres Database
3. Rest API Integration
4. User Login

## Stretch Features

## Things we enjoyed

### Andrew
1. I liked that this was a group project, because if there was something that I was having trouble with, then I could very easily get some support from my groupmate, which would've been impossible in the individual project.'
2. I liked that this project was a lot more open ended, which allowed our creativity to flow in a way that was just not possible with the Individual project.

### Jack
1. I also liked the fact that it was a group project. Being able to delegate certain features to my partner so that we could finish the project quicker was nice.
2. I liked that the project emphasized the topics we have learned, but did not require us to do much past that. I am swamped in work on other classes and another large project would have been the straw to break the camels back.

## Things that could've been better

### Andrew
1. I wish that we had more time so that we could get some more features done. I really wished that we could've given the webpage at least some CSS formatting, so that it doesn't look bare bones.
2. I wanted to learn how to attach a music file to a webpage. Unfortunately, since that was a stretch feature, that got cut off.

### Jack
1. I wish we would have had more time to incorporate more funcitonality into the recommendation. Doing this would make the recommendation a lot more robust and useful.
2. Maybe tried to use a new framework, so I could have learned something new.
